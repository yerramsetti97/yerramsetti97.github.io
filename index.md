## About Me
I am a **Backend Software Engineer with over 5 years of industry experience** dedicated to building the invisible architecture that powers modern web applications. My journey in software engineering began with a deep fascination for how data moves across global networks, leading me to specialize in **Distributed Systems, Data Modeling, and Cloud Infrastructure**. 

I believe that great software isn't just about writing code that works—it's about creating systems that are resilient, maintainable, and built to evolve. Throughout my career, I have transitioned from building core Java services to architecting modern, AI-enhanced backend solutions. Currently, I am focused on the intersection of **Backend Engineering and AI Integration**, exploring how Large Language Models and intelligent automation can be seamlessly embedded into production-grade systems to solve complex business challenges.

### What I Bring to the Table
* **Architectural Thinking:** I design with scale in mind, utilizing microservices and cloud-native patterns to ensure high availability and performance.
* **Problem Solving:** I thrive on debugging complex, cross-stack issues and optimizing systems where every millisecond of latency matters.
* **Continuous Growth:** As a Master’s student in Computer Science, I am constantly bridging the gap between academic theory (like advanced data modeling) and practical, real-world implementation.
