## Professional Profile

I am a **Backend Software Engineer with over 5 years of industry experience** dedicated to building the invisible architecture that powers modern web applications. My journey in software engineering is driven by a fascination with high-availability systems—the kind that remain invisible to the user because they never fail.

I specialize in **Distributed Systems and Cloud Infrastructure**, with a specific focus on creating resilient microservices that handle complex data workflows. I believe that engineering excellence is found at the intersection of clean code and rigorous system design. Rather than just solving immediate bugs, I focus on architecting for the next 10x growth milestone.

Currently, I am exploring the frontier of **Intelligent Backend Systems**. I am working on integrating Large Language Models and automated reasoning into production-grade backends, ensuring that AI-driven features maintain the same level of security and reliability as traditional enterprise services.

### My Core Philosophies

* **Architectural Resilience:** Systems should be designed to fail gracefully. I prioritize observability and fault-tolerance in every service I build.
* **Data Integrity First:** In a world of distributed data, maintaining a single source of truth is the hardest and most important task for a backend engineer.
* **Continuous Evolution:** As a Master’s student, I actively bridge the gap between academic theory—like advanced algorithms—and practical, production-ready implementation.
