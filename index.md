## About Me

[cite_start]I am a **Backend Software Engineer with over 5 years of industry experience** [cite: 5] [cite_start]specializing in the architecture of production-grade services and high-scale APIs[cite: 5, 7]. [cite_start]My engineering philosophy centers on the idea that backend systems should be "invisible"—seamless, resilient, and highly available even under the heaviest loads[cite: 7].

[cite_start]Throughout my career, I have evolved from developing core Java services to architecting complex, cloud-native distributed systems[cite: 5, 12, 19]. [cite_start]My current focus is at the intersection of **Systems Design and Artificial Intelligence** [cite: 2][cite_start], where I explore how to integrate LLM capabilities into enterprise-level backend workflows without sacrificing system integrity or performance[cite: 22].

### My Engineering Focus

* [cite_start]**Scalable Architecture:** I specialize in microservices and distributed systems that handle high-volume transactional data[cite: 19, 26].
* [cite_start]**Operational Excellence:** I am a strong advocate for automated CI/CD, comprehensive unit testing, and rigorous engineering standards[cite: 21, 29, 35].
* [cite_start]**Intelligent Systems:** I am actively bridging the gap between traditional backend reliability and modern AI/ML integration[cite: 22, 36, 52].
