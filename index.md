## About
I build fast, scalable web applications and integrate AI/LLM features end-to-end. I care about clean UX, robust APIs, observable systems, and measurable impact. Recently, I’ve been delivering AI-enabled features, hardening CI/CD releases on Kubernetes, and using telemetry to improve reliability and performance.

- Growth mindset; comfortable with evolving requirements and ambiguity  
- Strong in debugging, observability, and system health (logs/traces/metrics)  
- Focused on accessible, secure, and maintainable code
