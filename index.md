## About Me

I am a **Backend Software Engineer with over 5 years of industry experience** dedicated to building the invisible architecture that powers modern web applications. My expertise lies in **Distributed Systems, Data Modeling, and Cloud Infrastructure**, with a focus on creating high-performance, maintainable systems that solve complex business challenges.

I believe that great software isn't just about writing code that works—it's about creating systems that are resilient, maintainable, and built to evolve. Currently, I specialize in bridging the gap between intelligent automation and robust backend architecture by integrating AI/ML models into production workflows.
