  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Iâ€™m a Full Stack .NET Developer with over 7 years of experience designing and developing secure, scalable, and cloud-native enterprise applications across healthcare, finance, and cloud domains. My expertise lies in .NET 8, ASP.NET Core Web API, Angular, React, Azure, and DevOps pipelines, with a strong focus on performance optimization, clean architecture, and automation.

Iâ€™ve successfully modernized legacy systems into distributed microservice architectures hosted on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), improving scalability and deployment efficiency by over 50%. Iâ€™m also experienced in building FHIR/HIPAA-compliant APIs, integrating CI/CD automation, and implementing secure authentication and observability with Azure AD B2C, Redis, and Application Insights.

Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve led and collaborated with cross-functional Agile teams, working closely with product owners, architects, and stakeholders to deliver business-critical solutions. My development approach balances technical precision with user-centric design â€” ensuring every system I build is robust, maintainable, and built for scale.

Iâ€™m passionate about cloud technologies, distributed systems, and AI-assisted automation, and I thrive in environments that challenge me to innovate, learn continuously, and deliver measurable impact through technology.
